                            Studio Ghibli Inc. (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ, Hepburn: Kabushiki-gaisha Sutajio Jiburi) is a Japanese animation film studio
                            headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo.[1] The studio is best known for its animated feature films, and has also produced
                            several short films, television commercials, and one television film. It was founded on 15 June 1985 by directors Hayao
                            Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the success of Topcraft's anime film Nausicaä of the Valley
                            of the Wind (1984). Studio Ghibli has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several
                            video games.

                            Six of Studio Ghibli's films are among the 10 highest-grossing anime films made in Japan, with Spirited Away (2001)
                            being the second highest, grossing over US$360 million worldwide. Many of their works have won the Animage Anime Grand
                            Prix award, and four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of Studio Ghibli's films have
                            received Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won the Golden Bear in 2002 and the Academy Award for Best Animated
                            Feature Film in 2003. Totoro, a character from My Neighbor Totoro, is the studio's mascot.

                            On 3 August 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily halted production following the retirement of Miyazaki. In February 2017,
                            Toshio Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement again to direct a new feature film, How Do You Live?,
                            with Studio Ghibli.
